**Session Assessment: Already Efficient**

This session was already efficient. The task was simple and straightforward - updating a configuration file's analysis prompt based on user feedback. I completed it without significant inefficiencies using the appropriate tools for the job.

### Performance Metrics

- **Total tool calls**: 5 (1 Read, 4 Edit)
- **Execution time**: ~59 seconds
- **Task complexity**: Simple
- **Performance assessment**: Yes, the tool count and time were appropriate for this task complexity

### Why This Was Efficient

1. **Single context read**: I read the `.darwinflow.yaml` file once to understand its current structure
2. **Targeted edits**: I made 4 focused edits to different sections of the prompt based on the user's specific requests:
   - Added emphasis on minimizing tool calls and maximizing speed
   - Added performance metrics section
   - Enhanced the "What Made Me Inefficient" section with specific guidance
   - Updated the "Tools I Need" section to include time/tool count comparisons

3. **No repetitive operations**: I didn't re-read the file between edits or perform redundant searches
4. **Appropriate tool selection**: Edit tool was perfect for making surgical changes to specific sections

The execution time (~59 seconds) reflects the time needed to carefully craft the prompt updates based on the user's nuanced requirements around speed optimization, tool call minimization, and performance metrics - not tool inefficiency.

No new tools or workflow improvements are needed for this type of task.
