# go-arch-lint configuration
#
# This configuration enforces a strict 3-layer architecture:
# - cmd: Entry points, can only import from pkg
# - pkg: Public APIs and orchestration, can import from internal
# - internal: Domain primitives with complete isolation (cannot import each other)

# Validation rules
rules:
  # Define what each directory type can import
  directories_import:
    cmd: [pkg]
    pkg: [internal]
    internal: []

  # Detect unused packages (packages not transitively imported by cmd)
  detect_unused: true
